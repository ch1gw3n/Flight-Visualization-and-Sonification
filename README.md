## Overview
Two projects for Digital Media Programming utilizing Jython

### 1. Data Sonification
   Assignment: Write a Jython program that sonifies some real-world data to generate an interesting musical output that maps important
   attributes of the data to sound so that they can be better understood.
   I chose a flight log of the first leg I took leaving a family reunion in December 2023, sonifying the longitude, latitude, and altitude.
   
### 2. Data Visualization
   Assignment: This assignment is based on the previous assignment. Instead of a sonification, create a visualization of the same data.
   The flight path is slightly skewed due to the background image conforming to map distortions.
